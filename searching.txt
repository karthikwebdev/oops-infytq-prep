binary tree searching:

    first we will take a root value 
    next if we find a value that is less than root then that will be sent to left side
    if greater than root then right side

types of binary trees:

    1) strictly mandatory tree : here a node must have 2 or 0 children if 1 child is there then it is not strictly mandatory
    2) complete binary tree : 
    3) full binary : 

representation of binary search tree:

    in order : left root right
    pre order : root left right
    post order : left right root
    level order : according to levels


inorder : 8 4 9 2 10 5 11 1 6 13 3 14 7
preorder : 1 2 4 8 9 5 10 11 3 6 13 7 14
post order : 8 9 4 10 11 

we can draw a tree if we have post and in , pre and inorders
